ESTIMATE A VALUE FOR NON-RESPONDERS (THOSE RESPONDING DON'T KNOW OR REFUSE TO 
ACTUAL INCOME AMOUNTS).  THE DECISION RULES FOR FILLING IN INDIVIDUAL MISSING 
INCOME VALUES WITH ESTIMATES ARE AS FOLLOWS:
 
IF SELF-REPORTED RANGES ARE GIVEN AND (EXAMPLE T09126.00, T09128.00):
*UPPER/LOWER VALUES ARE IN PROPER ORDER, MIDPOINT IS USED;
*RANGES ARE GIVEN BACKWARDS, THE VALUES ARE REVERSED AND MIDPOINT IS USED;
*THE SAME VALUE IS GIVEN FOR UPPER/LOWER SELF-REPORTED RANGE VALUE, THAT SINGLE 
VALUE IS USED;
 
IF UNFOLDING BRACKETS ARE ANSWERED (LOW BRACKET < ENTRY VALUE < HIGH BRACKET) 
AND (EXAMPLE T09129.00-T09131.00):
*R REPORTS LESS THAN ENTRY VALUE AND LESS THAN LOW BRACKET, THEN HALF OF LOW 
BRACKET VALUE IS USED (MIDPOINT BETWEEN LOW BRACKET AND 0)
* R REPORTS LESS THAN ENTRY VALUE BUT GREATER THAN LOW BRACKET VALUE, MIDPOINT 
BETWEEN LOW BRACKET AND ENTRY VALUE IS USED;
*R REPORTS GREATER THAN ENTRY VALUE BUT LESS THAN HIGH BRACKET VALUE, MIDPOINT 
BETWEEN ENTRY VALUE AND HIGH BRACKET IS USED;
*R REPORTS GREATER THAN ENTRY VALUE AND GREATER THAN HIGH BRACKET VALUE, THE
