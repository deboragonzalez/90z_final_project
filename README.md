# Invest in Women: How A Mother's Education Affect Her Children's Future
### Debora Gonzalez

A mother's role in her children's economic and social mobility has been often overlooked in favor of the father's. Given that men often were the sole financial provider and source of social standing for their families, their role in the study of mobility was amplified. In recent decades, however, women have increasingly gained access to education and the workforce. Their impact on their children's outcome has become more and more noticeable. This study analyzes the association between a mother's education (assumed to occur early in the causal chain) and her child's economic and educational outcome. Furthermore, this study explores for whom mother's education matter most and why emphasizing the role women have in shaping the children's mobility.
